## Employee Contact Form Backend

This is a Nestjs api to perform CRUD operations on a employee details<br>
The API performs the following operations:
<ul>
    <li>Create Employee with multiple contact details (Relationship mapping)</li>
    <li>List Employee (with pagination)</li>
    <li>Update Employee</li>
    <li>Delete Employee</li>
    <li>Get Employee</li>
</ul>

<br>
    It took me around 4-5 hours to complete the assignment.
